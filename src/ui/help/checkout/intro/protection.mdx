To protect our buyers at **stop-n-swop** we supply an **Order Protection** service for all transactions.

In order to facilitate this, we take a small fee to _protect_ the order. This is included in the standard price of the item.

**Order protection** means we withhold payment until the buyer has received the item and is happy with it. Once the buyer has confirmed they _are_ happy with the item, the payment is then released to the seller.

If the product is not in the advertised condition, or it does not arrive, the buyer can request a refund, return the item, and get their money back!
