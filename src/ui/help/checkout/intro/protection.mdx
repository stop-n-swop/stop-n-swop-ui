We've all bought things off marketplaces, given our money away, and then received a dud product - _or no product_ - while the seller has conveniently gone awol.

To protect our buyers at **stop-n-swop** we supply a protection service for all transactions.

In order to facilitate this, we apply a small fee on the base price of all products. This is the amount you'll see throughout the site so there's no surprises when you reach the checkout!

Buyer protection means until you have received your purchase and are happy with it, your payment is not released to the seller.

If the product is not in the advertised condition, if it does not arrive in time, or if you receive a counterfit or fake product, you can request a refund without any hassle.
