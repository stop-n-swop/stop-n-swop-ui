## Create your listing

Creating your listing just takes a few simple steps. Get started <AnchorButton target="_blank" href="/list" className="inline-flex" kind="tertiary">here</AnchorButton>.

### <a id="region" href="#region" className="button">Region</a>

A game will have a region code depending on where in the world it was released. Some games were only released in one country, but most will have been released worldwide.

Most retro consoles are region locked, meaning a console from one region can only play games from the same region.

Telling us your region code helps to ensure we show your listing to the right buyers. Some people also like to collect all regions of a game, or all games from a specific region.

If you're not sure what region your game is, you can skip this step.

### <a id="condition" href="#condition" className="button">Condition</a>

Condition is a highly subjective property so hopefully these descriptions can help you decide what to pick

#### Mint

<img src={mint} alt="mint condition" />

<p>{useMessage(ids.listings.new.condition.descriptions.mint)}</p>

#### Like new

<img src={likeNew} alt="like new condition" />

<p>{useMessage(ids.listings.new.condition.descriptions.likeNew)}</p>

#### Used

<img src={used} alt="used condition" />

<p>{useMessage(ids.listings.new.condition.descriptions.used)}</p>

This is the most common state for older games.

#### Poor

<img src={poor} alt="poor condition" />

<p>{useMessage(ids.listings.new.condition.descriptions.poor)}</p>

Keep in mind that there might be some cross over. A "used" game might be unboxed without instructions, but a "poor" game might have both but in poor condition. Keep this in mind when deciding what condition to pick.

We will ask about whether you have the instructions/box in the next step.

### <a id="photos" href="#photos" className="button">Photos</a>

Based on the game, platform, and previous questions, we ask you to upload some photos of your game.

<img src={guide03} alt="photos example" className="xs:max-w-screen-xs" />

Make sure the photos are clear and any serial numbers and markings are visible. We would also advise that you take all your photos together as this helps our verification process.

### <a id="price" href="#price" className="button">Price</a>

Enter the amount you want to sell your game for.

Stop N Swop charges a small fee which is clearly broken down for you on this step. You can view more about these fees <LinkButton to="/guide/fees-and-charges" className="inline-flex" kind="tertiary">here</LinkButton>.

For domestic listings your price should include any postage costs.

### <a id="extras" href="#extras" className="button">Extras</a>

This step allows you to configure additional settings and services. Currently this only includes adding a note about your listing, but some exciting new extras will be coming soon.

  <LinkButton to="/guide/selling/receive-an-order" className="inline-flex">
