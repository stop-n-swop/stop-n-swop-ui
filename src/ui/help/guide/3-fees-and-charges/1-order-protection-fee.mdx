## Order protection fee

To protect our buyers at Stop N Swop we supply an **Order Protection** service for all transactions.

We charge a small fee to _protect_ the order, approximately 5% of the total price. This fee is _included_ in the standard price of the item and is broken down during both the listing and checkout processes.

**Order protection** means payment is held until the buyer has received the item and has confirmed they are happy with it. Once the buyer has confirmed they _are_ happy with the item, the payment is then released to the seller.

If the product is not in the advertised condition, or it does not arrive, the buyer can request a refund, return the item, and get their money back.
