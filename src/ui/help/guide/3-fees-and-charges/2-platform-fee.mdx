## Platform fee

The platform fee is Stop N Swop's charge for selling an item on our platform.

It consists of:

- 4% of the listed price
- 30p fixed price

We only charge fees on completed listings. If you list an item but never sell it, there's nothing to pay.

When the buyer has purchased an item and the order has completed successfully, we will automatically deduct the platform fee from the final amount.

We want to be transparent so we will break down your fees throughout the listing and selling process for you.
