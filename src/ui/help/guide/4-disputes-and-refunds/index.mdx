## Disputes and refunds

### Disputes

If your item arrives and it is not in the advertised condition, click _**Received**_ and then _**Something's wrong**_. We will contact you directly in order to determine the best course of action.

We may ask for some more detail on the issue you have, as well as photos if applicable.

If possible, we will attempt to resolve your dispute with the seller. However, you can request a straight return/refund if you want.

### Refunds

You can request a refund if you are unhappy with your item under our <LinkButton to="/guide/fees-and-charges/order-protection" className="inline-flex">order protection</LinkButton> policy.

In the event of a refund, we will ask you to return the item to the seller. We will provide the return address and talk you through the return process.

Once the item has been returned to the seller, we will refund your payment, less the <LinkButton to="/guide/fees-and-charges/order-protection" className="inline-flex">order protection fee</LinkButton>

We will liaise with the seller to ensure the item has been returned to them. However, if for whatever reason we are unable to get a response from them, we will just trigger the refund for you.
