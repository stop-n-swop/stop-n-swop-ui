## How it works

Creating a new listing is easy and only takes a few steps:

### Find the game you want to sell

You can do that from this page, or head to the games page to fine tune your search. Each game's page has a "list this game" button.

### Enter your game's condition info

Tell us your game's region, condition, whether it's boxed, etc.

### Upload some photos

The uploads are specific to the game you're selling and the condition it's in.

### Open your listing!

Now you just wait for a buyer to snap up your item!

## Other bits

### Set up your PayPal email

We use <a className="text-secondary-lightest" href="https://paypal.com" target="_blank">PayPal</a> to process payouts and withdrawals so you'll need to let us know what your preferred paypal email address is. It doesn't matter if you already have a paypal account or not.

### Fees and charges

We want to be as transparent as possible when it comes to pricing so we'll break down your costs as you go. Our fee structure is pretty straight forward:

- There are no fees for listing. You can cancel your listing at any time for free.
- We charge an Order Protection fee of 5%, this covers the buyer in the event that something goes wrong with their order
- We charge a Platform fee of 4% plus £0.30 when your listing has sold.

All of the fees are clearly broken down and explained during the listing process so there's no surprises!
