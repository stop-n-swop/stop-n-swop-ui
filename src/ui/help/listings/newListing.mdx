## Listing a game

Creating a new listing is easy and only takes a few steps:

1. **Register as a seller**

   If you haven't already, you'll need to complete a few details in order to sell items:

   - pick a username
   - register your address
   - supply the bank account details where you want your sale funds to be sent

2. **Find the game you want to sell**

   You can do that from this page, or head to the games page to fine tune your search. Each game's page has a "list this game" button.

3. **Enter your game's condition info**

   Tell us your game's region, condition, whether it's boxed, etc.

4. **Upload some photos**

   The uploads are specific to the game you're selling and the condition it's in. Only 1 photo is mandatory, but the more you upload, the better your listing's rating

5. **Create your listing!**

## Fees and charges

We want to be as transparent as possible when it comes to pricing so we'll break down your pricing as you go. Our fee structure is pretty straight forward:

- There are no fees for listing. You can cancel your listing at any time for free.
- We charge a flat <BaseChargeRate/> upon the sale of your listing
- For low value items we may need to apply a small additional charge to cover costs. This is only for very low value items (< £5) so usually doesn't apply.
