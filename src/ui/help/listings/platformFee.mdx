The **platform fee** is **stop-n-swop**'s charge for selling an item on our platform.

We only charge fees on completed listings. If you list an item but never sell it, there's nothing to pay.

When the buyer has purchased your listing and the order has completed successfully, we will automatically deduct the platform fee when transferring the funds to your balance.
