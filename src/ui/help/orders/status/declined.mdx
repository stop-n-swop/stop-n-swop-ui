## Declined

Your order was declined by the seller.

### An order could be declined for a number of reasons:

- The listing was sold before you completed the checkout process
- There were multiple buyers attempting to buy the item at the exact same time. In this case the seller must decide which order "wins".
- The item was no longer for sale or the seller changed their mind
