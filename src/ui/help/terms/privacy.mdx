## We really care about privacy at Stop N Swop

We only collect data that is absolutely essential to the running of our application. We don't collect anything without your consent, and we certainly don't sell your data on.

## Cookies

We also _hate_ cookies so rest assured there are no annoying privacy banners and no intrusive tracking. The only long-term detail we store on your machine is your current login session token.

## Uploads

When you upload data, such as photos, we store these externally and indefinitely. If you remove an upload or decide not to finalise a listing, your upload will be permenantly deleted during a daily cleanup process.

## Third parties

We use a number of third parties that we only share data with that is essential to the application:

- PaPal for payment processing. We don't store or collect any of your payment details
- SMTP for email contact. Emails we send are related to your account activity (buying and selling, for instance). You can completely customise what emails you receive from us.
- We use [datacenturion](https://datacenturion.io) to collect site analytics. This is a privacy-first and annonymous tool. We don't send any details about you or your account.

## Privacy policy changes

Although this policy is unlikely to change very often, we reserve the right to update it from time to time.
